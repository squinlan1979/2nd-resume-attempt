	This past summer, while serving as the Director of the Yale Summer Session program in Italy, I made the mistake
of thinking that I had to do everything on my own.  While leading our first field trip with a group of 49 students, I became
flustered and overwhelmed by trying to keep track of so many students in a crowded town.  I quickly realized, though, that I had
a team of six capable colleagues who were not additional people for me to keep track of, but rather my allies in managing our
crowd.  On our subsequent field trip, this large group went to Florence.  I broke the group into smaller “platoons,” each led by
one of my colleagues.  This made us more mobile, got us to where we needed to go in a timely fashion, and made head-counts much
easier.

	While this example deals specifically with moving large groups of people, the lesson carried over to day-to-day 
operations.  I had major responsibilities, but I realized that doing my job well did not mean doing everything myself.  Each of
my colleagues had particular strengths that I was able to call upon in specific situations in order to complete program
objectives effectively.
