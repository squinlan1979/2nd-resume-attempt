**1** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am attracted to programming because of how it engages curiosity, critical thinking, and creativity.
I rely on all of these in my work as a teacher and a researcher. I want to apply these in a new way, taking advantage of my
technical aptitude.  My tech skills have so far been underutilized—in no small measure because of my own internalized ideas
about who does high-tech work.  Growing up, the only people I saw using computers beyond word-processing were boys.  Programs
like ADA, as well as female colleagues at Yale who use coding in their work, have underscored for me that women not only have a
place in programming, but they have an important voice that has not been fully heard yet.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been exposed to programming directly and indirectly at work and in classes.  I used Dreamweaver to make a Web site for a
foreign language class.  My fundraising work involved heavy use of databases and Excel.  At Target Software, I excitedly learned
what was happening inside of the database, as well as how to extract data more efficiently using custom reports and SQL
statements.  I have also completed the first set of HTML Basics on Codecademy.com.


**3** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This past summer, while serving as the Director of the Yale Summer Session program in Italy, I made the
mistake of thinking that I had to do everything on my own.  While leading our first field trip with a group of 49 students, I
became flustered and overwhelmed by trying to keep track of so many students in a crowded town.  I quickly realized, though,
that I had
a team of six capable colleagues who were not additional people for me to keep track of, but rather my allies in managing our
crowd.  On our subsequent field trip, this large group went to Florence.  I broke the group into smaller “platoons,” each led by
one of my colleagues.  This made us more mobile, got us to where we needed to go in a timely fashion, and made head-counts much
easier.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this example deals specifically with moving large groups of people, the lesson carried over to day-to-day 
operations.  I had major responsibilities, but I realized that doing my job well did not mean doing everything myself.  Each of
my colleagues had particular strengths that I was able to call upon in specific situations in order to complete program
objectives effectively.

**4** &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the skills necessary to complete this application, I once taught myself to take apart 
my sink and successfully put it back together again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One night, I dropped an earring down my bathroom sink.  I tried to fish it out, but determined that I
needed to take the pipe apart.  I looked carefully at the pipes to understand how they fit together, and how they function.  I
consulted Google.  Based on diagrams online, I was able to understand how to take out the U-Pipe, while also catching the water
that was freed from the sink.  I retrieved my earring.  While reassembling the pipes, I had to reconnect the mechanism that
controls the drain plug.  I saw how it interacted with the pipes, set it in place, and screwed the pipes back together.  It was
not easy, but I was determined and I saw it through. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always when I’m learning something, I like to have a macro-level understanding of how that thing 
works.  With this knowledge, I understand, assimilate, and remember micro-level information much better.  I am also a tenacious 
learner and do not quit until I understand what I have set out to learn.
